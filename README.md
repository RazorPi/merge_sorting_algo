**M2 / Problem 3:** Learn Data Structures by building the Merge Sorting Algorithm


---
### About:
The merge sort algorithm mainly performs three actions:
* Divide an unsorted sequence of items into sub-parts
* Sort the items in the sub-parts
* Merge the sorted sub-parts
The above happens recursively until the sub-parts are merged into the complete sorted sequence. Let's start by dividing the sequence

### TIPS:
You can use the __name__ (__underscore underscore name underscore underscore_)variable to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module (code written in another Python file).
If the value of __name__ is set to '__main__', it implies that the current script is the main program, and not a module.
